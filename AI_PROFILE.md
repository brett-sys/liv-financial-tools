**Name:** Brett Dunham

**Role:** Agency Owner at LIV Financial Group (www.livfinancialgroup.com)

**What I do:** I run an insurance agency specializing in IUL (Indexed Universal Life), Term Life, and Final Expense products. I manage a team of agents and build internal tools to streamline our operations.

**My team:**
- Brett Dunham (me) — Agency Owner, brett@fflliv.com
- Kevin Nelson — Agent
- Easton Passolt — Agent
- Joe — Agent

**CRM:** Go High Level (Elite 360) — I use the GHL API for contact management, workflows, and lead distribution.

**Tech stack I use:**
- Python (Flask for web apps, Tkinter for desktop apps)
- SQLite for local databases
- Google Sheets API (gspread) for reporting and data
- Google Drive API for file management
- Cloudflare Tunnels for sharing local apps with my team
- Cursor IDE on Mac (macOS, Apple Silicon)
- Git/GitHub for version control
- WeasyPrint for PDF generation
- SMTP (Gmail) for email automation

**Tools I've built:**
1. **Call Logger** — Flask web app for tracking agent calls, with per-agent themes, Google Sheets weekly exports, calendar integration, and Cloudflare tunnel sharing
2. **Lead Manager** — Flask web app that pulls CSV lead files from Google Drive and imports contacts into Go High Level (Elite 360) with agent tags
3. **Underwriting Risk Assessment** — Tkinter desktop app with 15 insurance carriers, BMI/build charts, medical conditions, and rating logic
4. **PDF Generator** — Tkinter app for generating IUL illustrations, policy submitted packets, business cards, quote comparisons, and referral tracking
5. **Password Vault** — Flask web app with PIN auth, Fernet encryption, and dark theme
6. **Lead Capture Landing Page** — Static HTML form with Google Apps Script backend
7. **Gmail to Sheets Automation** — Google Apps Script that parses lead emails into Google Sheets

**How I work:**
- I move fast and want things done quickly
- I prefer dark-themed UIs
- I like plug-and-play solutions — minimal setup
- I'm not deeply technical but I understand the concepts
- I use Google Sheets and Google Drive heavily for data
- I share tools with my team via Cloudflare tunnels or public URLs
- I'm looking into Railway for permanent cloud hosting

**When I ask for help:**
- Keep explanations short and direct
- Don't over-explain — just build it or tell me what to do
- If something needs a decision, give me options as quick choices
- I type fast and casual — interpret typos generously
- I care about results, not process

**Insurance knowledge:**
- I know IUL, Term, and Final Expense products deeply
- I work with carriers: National Life, Transamerica, Mutual of Omaha, Americo, Ethos/Ameritas, Ladder, TruStage, Accendo/Aetna, Royal Neighbors, Living Promise, Fidelity Life, Family Freedom
- I understand underwriting: BMI/build charts, table ratings, tobacco/DUI/diabetes/cancer guidelines, knockout and declinable medical conditions
- I use lead vendors like LeadBoom and Ethos for lead generation
